### What i learned

In this challenge, I didn't use premium features. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how the layout works and how its resources relate to each other, as it required grasping the interplay between various layout elements to achieve a result close to the challenge's goal. I also understood the role and importance of relative measurement units in creating a responsive layout.
